Question 1: What kind of output does the system give?
 predict [e]
For all the instances in the data, the model predicts:
likely to commit a crime, 8.101%
unlikely to commit a crime, 91.899%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2: What kind of data was the system trained on?
 self and function and data [e]
I'm a machine learning model trained to predict whether someone will commit a crime. I was trained on a recidivism prediction dataset.

I can answer questions about the model's predictions on the data. For example, I could tell you why certain predictions were made, how likely different outcomes are, what needs to happen to get different predictions, or what would happen to the predictions if the features changed in a particular way.

 I can perform these analyses on individual instances (i.e., using the instance id) or entire subgroups in the data.

If you want to see whether I can do something, try asking it!The data contains information related to recidivism prediction.

The exact feature names in the data are listed as follows:
age
recidivated
numberofpriorcrimes
monthsinjail
felony
misdemeanor
woman
man
black

The model scores 84.964% accuracy on the data.

Question 14: What is the systems overall logic?
 filter man true and important topk 3 [e]
For the model's predictions on instance with man equal to true, the top 3 most important features are as follows, where 1 is the most important feature:

Question 15: What features of instance 1371 determine the systemâ€™s prediction of it?
 filter id 1371 and explain cfe [e]
For instances where id equal to 1371, the original prediction is unlikely to commit a crime. Here are some options to change the prediction of this instance.

First, if you increase recidivated to 1.0 and increase monthsinjail to 438, the model will predict likely to commit a crime.

In addition, if you increase recidivated to 1.0 and increase monthsinjail to 676, the model will predict likely to commit a crime.
