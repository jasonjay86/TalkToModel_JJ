Heart Data - MLP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the most prominent features?

For the model's predictions across all the data, the importance of the features have the following ranking, where 1 is the most important feature:

1: resting_blood_pressure
2: maximum_heart_rate_achieved
3: Chest_Pain_Type
4: fasting_blood_sugar
5: number_of_major_vessels_colored_by_flourosopy
6: _resting_electrocardiographic_results
7: exercise_induced_angina
8: thal
9: _the_slope_of_the_peak_exercise_ST_segment
10: Sex
11: Age
12: serum_cholestoral
13: _oldpeak

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What records does the model predict incorrectly?

For all the instances in the data, the model typically predicts incorrect:

if (thal > 4.5) and (serum_cholestoral > 244.5) and (resting_blood_pressure > 119.0) then then the model is incorrect 100.0% over 15 samples

if (thal > 4.5) and (serum_cholestoral <= 244.5) and (number_of_major_vessels_colored_by_flourosopy > 0.5) then then the model is incorrect 83.33% over 6 samples

if (thal <= 4.5) and (resting_blood_pressure > 156.0) then then the model is incorrect 100.0% over 2 samples

if (thal <= 4.5) and (resting_blood_pressure <= 156.0) and (maximum_heart_rate_achieved <= 93.5) then then the model is incorrect 100.0% over 1 samples




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is instance 189 given this prediction?

For instances with id equal to 189 predicted absence of heart disease:
resting_blood_pressure is the most important feature and has a negative influence on the predictions
maximum_heart_rate_achieved is the second most important feature and has a positive influence on the predictions
number_of_major_vessels_colored_by_flourosopy is the third most important feature and has a positive influence on the predictions

I can provide a more comprehensive overview of how important different features in the data are for the model's predictions, just ask for more description &#129502
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should instance 189 change for a different result?

Exception getting bot response: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'index'
Sorry! I couldn't understand that. Could you please try to rephrase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is age used for predictions?

For the model's predictions across all the data, the Age feature is ranked on average 9.25 (95% CI [8.645, 9.855]). Here, rank 1 is the most important feature (out of 13 features).

Compared to other instances in the data, Age is a not very important feature.
