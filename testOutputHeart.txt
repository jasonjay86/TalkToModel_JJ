Question 2: What kind of data was the system trained on?
 self and function and data [e]
I'm a machine learning model trained to predict whether someone has heart disease. I was trained on a heart disease dataset.

I can answer questions about the model's predictions on the data. For example, I could tell you why certain predictions were made, how likely different outcomes are, what needs to happen to get different predictions, or what would happen to the predictions if the features changed in a particular way.

 I can perform these analyses on individual instances (i.e., using the instance id) or entire subgroups in the data.

If you want to see whether I can do something, try asking it!The data contains information related to heart disease.

The exact feature names in the data are listed as follows:
Age
Sex
Chest_Pain_Type
resting_blood_pressure
serum_cholestoral
fasting_blood_sugar
_resting_electrocardiographic_results
maximum_heart_rate_achieved
exercise_induced_angina
_oldpeak
_the_slope_of_the_peak_exercise_ST_segment
number_of_major_vessels_colored_by_flourosopy
thal

The model scores 77.941% accuracy on the data.

 filter id 101 and explain cfe [e]
For instances where id equal to 101, the original prediction is absence of heart disease. Here are some options to change the prediction of this instance.

First, if you increase _resting_electrocardiographic_results to 2.0 and increase _oldpeak to 1.4, the model will predict presence of heart disease.

Also, if you increase _oldpeak to 3.5 and increase thal to 6.0, the model will predict presence of heart disease.
