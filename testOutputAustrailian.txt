--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2: What kind of data was the system trained on?
 self and function and data [e]
I'm a machine learning model trained to predict whether someone is good or bad credit risk. I was trained on a credit risk dataset.

I can answer questions about the model's predictions on the data. For example, I could tell you why certain predictions were made, how likely different outcomes are, what needs to happen to get different predictions, or what would happen to the predictions if the features changed in a particular way.

 I can perform these analyses on individual instances (i.e., using the instance id) or entire subgroups in the data.

If you want to see whether I can do something, try asking it!The data contains information related to credit risk.

The exact feature names in the data are listed as follows:
a1
a2
a3

Question 15: What features of instance 474 determine the systemâ€™s prediction of it?
 filter id 474 and explain cfe [e]
For instances where id equal to 474, the original prediction is bad credit risk. Here are some options to change the prediction of this instance.

First, if you increase a14 to 22641.0, the model will predict good credit risk.

In addition, if you increase a13 to 1854.0 and increase a14 to 20442.0, the model will predict good credit risk.

In addition, if you increase a7 to 11.9 and increase a14 to 9134.0, the model will predict good credit risk.

a14 is the second most important feature and has a negative influence on the predictions
a5 is the third most important feature and has a negative influence on the predictions
